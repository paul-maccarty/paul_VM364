##Event Presentation
####By Paul MacCarty

For my event(s), I attended the first and third meetings for [Emerson Game Developers]
(https://www.facebook.com/groups/168889850143377/).

In the first meeting, we all introduced ourselves and got acquainted with the heads of the
club: **Kathryn Knutsen** and **Sarah Spiers**.  The first meeting ran a bit short, simply
because they wanted to get a sense of what potential club members wanted through their
affiliation with the organization.  This was also a chance to set the pace for the semester
ahead.

Originally, the organization was called _'Girls Make Games'_.  The mission statement was to
promote a club that:

>"Focused on the history and current state of women in the games industry."

Given the open nature of the group, and its recognition of all identities, they have since
changed the name to _'Emerson Game Developers'_, so as to not seem too exclusive as such
a new organization.  In due time, they reassured us that a group for women in games **will**
come to fruition.

I was unable to attend the second meeting because it was held on a Thursday instead of the
usual Tuesday 7PM to 8PM slot in Emerson's [Engagement Lab](http://elab.emerson.edu/).

At the third meeting, February 2, 2016, we discussed what constitutes a game and had a
discussion about 'fun'.  This helped rectify any questions or confusion I had pertaining
to the Salen and Zimmerman readings.  After this refresher, we broke into groups and played
our own version of **Build-A-Game**.  Following a similar pattern of social responsibility
and civic engagement, our group came up with a concept about purifying water by collecting
materials along a river bank while trying to avoid self-deprecating locals who wanted things
to stay the same.

Toward the end of the meeting, Kathryn and Sarah demoed **two games** that tread that line 
of game vs. not-game.  In fact, [_Loneliness_](http://www.kongregate.com/games/jordanmagnuson/loneliness)
clarifies at the end of the game that it is a _non-game_ trying to promote awareness for
loneliness of children in Korean middle schools.  It's a beautifully simplistic game in which,
you control a solitary square.  As you move up/forward in space toward other square clusters,
they break apart and avoid you at all costs until the clouded background ramps out to black.
Some players disapproved of the outright clarification of what the game _was_ or rather,
_was not_, at its' conclusion.  I personally thought it was necessary and added some weight
to the message the game was clearly trying to get across.  Perhaps a more subtle way to
get the word out would have been better; for example, linking to the developers' site where
he talks about his thought process and engages in a forum with players.  The mechanic was 
smooth and simple enough to complete the game in under four minutes.  With relatively low
re-play value, I think the point of this _non-game_ is simply to promote activism and
action, not necessarily provide 'fun' stimulation.

We also played [_Mountain_](http://store.steampowered.com/app/313340/) created by the lead
animator/graphic designer/vfx supervisor of Spike Jonze's _Her_.  The game's visual appeal
was particularly high and it wasn't unpleasant to look at.  Based on a number of user-drawn
sketches, you watch a mountain in space live through the seasons.  It took us nearly 20 minutes
and a google search to realize that there were a number of keystroke combinations or cheats
that did things in the game.  With supposedly over 50 hours of play, this game served as an
interesting, interactive fire-place-like simulation than an actual game for me.  Nonetheless,
for a dollar on the steam store, it might be for you!
