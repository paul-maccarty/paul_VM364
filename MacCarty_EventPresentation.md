\f0\fs24 \cf0 For my event(s), I attended the first and third meetings for Emerson Game Developers (https://www.facebook.com/groups/168889850143377/).  \
\
In the first meeting, we all introduced ourselves and got acquainted with the heads of the club: Kathryn Knutsen and Sarah Spiers.  The first meeting ran a bit short, simply because they wanted to get a sense of what potential members wanted through club affiliation and also kind of set the pace for the semester ahead.  \
\
Originally, the organization was named \'91Girls Make Games.\'92  The mission statement was to promote a club that \'93focused on the history and current state of women in the games industry.\'94  Given the open nature of the group and its recognition of all identities, they have changed the name to \'91Emerson Game Developers,\'92 so as to not seem too exclusive as such a new organization. In due time, they reassured us that a group for women in games will come to fruition.\
\
I was unable to attend the second meeting because it was held on a Thursday instead of the usual Tuesday 7 P.M. to 8 P.M. in Emerson\'92s Game Engagement Lab (http://elab.emerson.edu/).\
\
At the third meeting, February 2, 2016, we discussed what constitutes a game and had a discussion about \'91fun.\'92  This helped rectify any questions or confusion I had pertaining to the Salen and Zimmerman readings.  After this refresher, we broke up into groups and played our own version of build-a-game.  Following a similar pattern of social responsibility and civic engagement, our group came up with a concept about purifying water by collecting materials along a river bank while trying to avoid self-deprecating locals who wanted things to stay the same.\
\
Toward the end of the meeting, Kathryn and Sarah demoed two games that tread that line of game vs. not-game.  In fact, \'93Loneliness,\'94 clarifies at the end of the game that it is a non-game trying to promote awareness for loneliness of children in Korean middle schools.  It\'92s a beautifully simplistic game in which you control a solitary square.  As you move up/forward in space toward other square clusters, they break apart and avoid you at all costs until the clouded background ramps out to black.  Some players disapproved of the outright clarification of what the game was about at its\'92 conclusion.  I personally thought it was necessary and added some weight to the message the game was clearly trying to get across.  Perhaps a more subtle way to get the word out, would have been to post a link to the game developer where he talks about his thought process and engages in a forum with players.  The mechanic was smooth and simple enough to complete the game in under 4 minutes.  With relatively low re-play value, I think the point of this \'91non-game\'92 is simply to promote activism and action, not heightened stimulation.\
\
We also played \'91Mountain,\'92 by the lead animator/graphic designer/vfx supervisor of Spike Jonze\'92s 
\i Her
\i0 .  The game\'92s visual appeal was particularly high and it wasn\'92t difficult to look at.  Based on a number of user-drawn sketches, you watch a mountain in space live through the seasons.  It took us nearly 20 minutes and a google search to realize that there were a number of keystroke combinations or cheats that did things in the game.  With supposedly over 50 hours of play, this game served more as an interactive fire-place simulation than an actual game for me.  Nonetheless, for a dollar on the steam store, it might be for you!}
